 * The syntax is similar to JSON5, with a few differences:
 * 1. Equals signs may be used in place of colons.
 * 2. Commas shall not be used as element delimiters.
 * 3. Genuine signed 64-bit integers are supported.
 * 4. Strings cannot straddle multiple lines.
 * 5. Single-quoted strings do not support escapes, like in Perl or Shell.
 *
 * You may copy it to `main.conf` and make modifications at your disposal.
